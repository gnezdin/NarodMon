Fony FAQ    2010-01-08 hukka
============================

Q: When I attempt to use my font, the space characters are too wide or narrow.

A: Try changing the width of glyph 128 to be the same width as the space
   character (32). It's not yet known if this glitch is due to a bug in Fony's
   font writing or Windows' font painting.


Q: My Fony-created font doesn't display in program X.

A: Most probably a fault in Fony's font generation. Delphi in particular seems
   to be very fussy about which fonts it accepts. I always try to improve the
   situation when I can.


Q: How can I get more than 256 glyphs/more than 2 colors in my font?

A: You can't. This is a limitation of the FNT format itself. While it's
   possible to use Fony to edit some other font formats, I don't plan on
   supporting non-FNT supported features anytime soon.
